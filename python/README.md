# Idealspy

Experimenting with implementing some simple algorithms from algebraic geometry, implemented in Python.  



## Test Coverage

To generate a new coverage report

```
pytest  --cov=ideals --cov-report xml:cov.xml tests
```

(Use the `cov.xml` option, since that's what the `coverage-gutters` extension in VS Code expects by default.)
