# ideals

Experimenting with writing a minimal computer algebra system in Java, with an emphasis 
on the calculation of Groebner bases, all written in plain Java. 

Desired characteristics of "ideals": 
- parameterized by coefficient rings/fields
- parameterized by monomial ordering
- usable as a library in other packages (rather than running through a separate command-line interface).

Forward-looking possibilities: 
- adaptation of Buchberger's algorithm to a system like Spark
